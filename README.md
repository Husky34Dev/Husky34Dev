# Bernardo Martínez (Husky34Dev)

Developer with a background in web app development and a specialization in Big Data & AI. I build smart systems that combine language models with structured data, using tools like FastAPI, MCP, SQLite, and Hugging Face.

I focus on crafting LLM agents that go beyond chat — agents that reason, act, and interact with real APIs and databases.

You’ll usually find me working on:
- Function-calling agents with tool orchestration
- FastAPI + MCP setups for data-backed interactions
- Lightweight, low-latency systems using Groq, Ollama, or OpenAI

Always learning. Always testing. Always keeping it simple.
