# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bernardo (Husky34Dev)

Curious mind with a background in web app development and a specialization in Big Data & AI. I enjoy building smart systems that blend language models with real-world data, especially through tools like FastAPI, MCP, SQLite, and Hugging Face.

Currently exploring the intersection between LLMs and structured reasoning â€” crafting agents that don't just chat, but *act*.

Youâ€™ll often find me hacking on:
- Function-calling agents with real-time tool use
- Custom pipelines using Groq, Ollama, or OpenAI
- Fast, minimal backends that get out of the way

Iâ€™m always learning, always experimenting â€” and always refactoring.
